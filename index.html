                                I created this project as part of the Free Code Camp Curriculum. This was a great project, as it got me to research and think about the use of landing pages.
                                I created a responsive product landing page for a company selling flower arrangement courses with a market place for selling product. This landing page has been designed with a goal to sign up more people into the Flowerli email list, for the products and the offers launch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The biggest challenge of this project was to create an original design for the website, it was also one of the most fun parts. While creating this project, I learned to use flexbox and was able to apply it on the website.

I was able to apply grid and finalise the project I created a responsive technical documentation page for Javascript basics. This project allowed me learn common patterns in arrangement of content and features in website mainly including technical documentations.

                            This is a responsive website - tribute page to Adam Ondra, Czech Professional Rock Climber from Brno. This project was part of the Free Code Camp Curriculum. Creating this site, I was able to practice some of the things I learned while creating my first portfolio site for the User Experience Course I completed previously. I believe that repetition aids learning. I was able to practice creating a responsive navigation menu using very basic Javascript, I also tried to apply best practices when using photos online featuring the licence and author names. I believe that it’s best to get the basics and best practices ingrained early. I used Github for version control and I also used Github to deploy my page.

                            This is the first full website that I made and fully deployed online. I created this website as part of the Career Foundry short course, however it has thought basics of front end development. I learned to use Atom code editor, basic version control using Github. I was able to deploy the website online. I purchased a domain name separate to my hosting. I was able to connect this domain name to my hosting provider by pointing the DNS records. I used FileZilla to upload the files to my hosting provider server to publish the website.

                        My name is Katarina Roberts and I am a front end developer with flair for User Experience in Aberdeen, UK.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I got interested in career in tech, when I felt that I was in a transition period of my life in 2018. Previously I graduated from Fine Arts at Gray’s School of Art at the Robert Gordon University in 2012, but found myself working in care to subsidise my art career. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I took up a complete career change User Experience Design Course with Career Foundry and I graduated from the program in the end of year 2019. I found that I enjoyed a short Front End for Designers Course with Career Foundry the most and I decided that I would like to concentrate on coding and programming, as that would work best for the life style that I am looking for. I know that this is a long haul process, but enjoying every part of it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From my experience of being a freelance artist and also my part time carer’s job, I can empathise with people and provide user centric support by being able to put myself into their shoes. I believe that this experience and the skills I developed in those roles help me apply real user empathy, which can create a difference in the products that I am creating. By understanding the user and the problems that need to be solved, it is much easier to create an empathy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By studying the user experience design, I am able to have those important conversation about users and perhaps challenge any features that may be unnecessary.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am good at and not afraid to  ask (difficult) questions, some times maybe the once that people think but nobody wants to say out loud. I am always willing and excited to learn new things and challenge any stale practices.
